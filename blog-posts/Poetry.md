# Poetry

This are some poems I wrote when I felt inspired. I have never claimed to be a good poet. Some might have meaning behind them, some might not, and some might just be from when I was frustrated in a national park's parking lot.

## Winds of Life

The winds of life blow \
left, right, up, and down.\
We are the leaves.\
Getting picked up, \
and going with the flow.

Where does it take us? \
We do not know. \
We have little arms and little legs \
to push ourselves where we want to go. \
But the wind is in control. 

What would life be if we had full control? \
Would we all live perfect lives? \
or would we all be bored, and then die. 

It does not matter, \
that is not the life we live. \
We must relax control and hope \
the winds take us \
where we were meant to go. 

## Green Grass Field

I woke up \
and the war was over.

There in the green grass field \
The birds were chirping \
The wind felt like the perfect breeze \
to cool off the warm sun.

A beautiful house stood upon the hills. \
An American flag flew high on it's front. \
I felt free, and comfortable.

But the bodies were still there, \
rotting in the field. 

## Parking Lot

Deep in a forest of earth, \
along side mountains and trees, \
is a parking lot.

Engines roar \
as they fight for a spot. \
Anger grows inside \
their cold metal shells. 

Surrounded by green meadows, \
and icy mountain tops. \
The beautiful sun shines upone the \
dark parking lot.

What brought us here? \
To fight over spots of concrete \
that define our day. \

In this quiet forest \
we are the noise.
