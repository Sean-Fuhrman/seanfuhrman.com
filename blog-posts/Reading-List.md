# My Reading List

(*) indicates a <ins>must read</ins>.

1. The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho (*) 

    A great book that ties in religion and spirituality into a personal journy. While I'm not religious, it can resonate with many different spiritual beliefs. It is an inspiring book. 

2. Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin(*)

    I loved the characters in this book yet hated how they acted. A very entertaining read with characters that are fun to analyze.

3. Remarkebly Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt 
   
   Made me not want to eat octopus ever again.

4. Meditations for Mortals by Oliver Burkeman
   
   I did not finish reading this book, but it has an interesting perspective on how to deal with human limitations. It is a philosophy for life that could help people.

5. The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss

    I could not put this book down once I started. An engaging fantasy tale that has a hogwarts-like school with more adult themes.
