# My Reading List

(*) indicates a <ins>must read</ins>.

1. The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho (*) 

    A great book that ties in religion and spirituality into a personal journy. While I'm not religious, I feel it can resonate with many different spiritual beliefs. I believe it made me more hopeful about the universe.

2. Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin(*)

    I loved the characters in this book yet hated how they acted. A very entertaining read with characters that are fun to analyze.

3. Remarkebly Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt 
   
   Also an amazing book, made me not want to eat octopus ever again.

4. Meditations for Mortals by Oliver Burkeman
   
   I am not finished reading this book, but it has an interesting perspective on how to deal with human limitations. It is a philosophy for life that could help people. Will this update when done reading.
